Instructions from http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt5sar/wiki and David’s crush course

1.	Make two directories
user/local/orbits
user/local/GMTSAR

2.	Download this orbit file:
http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/tar/ORBITS.tar
and it appears in my Downloads directory
and unpack in directory /usr/local/orbits by:
cd /usr/local/orbits
tar -xvf ~yayu/Downloads/ORBITS.tar

3.	Download GMTSAR branch 5.6
cd /usr/local
svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/GMTSAR/branches/5.6 GMTSAR

4.	Make and install GMTSAR
cd /usr/local/GMTSAR
./configure --with-orbits-dir=/usr/local/orbits
autoconf
make
make install

rehash

make sure everything is fine by trying:
escarp
SAT_baseline
P2p_ALOS.csh



An InSAR test:
1.	Download test_GMTSAR.tar from http://topex.ucsd.edu/gmtsar/downloads/ (choose: script to test all cases below)
2.	Create directory insar on desktop
cd ~yayu/Desktop
mkdir insar
3.	unpack in directory ~yayu/Deskto/insar by:
cd insar
tar -xvf ~yayu/Downloads/test_GMTSAR.tar
4.	have a look at the files in insar:
ls -l
more filelist
5.	m get_unpack_one.com
6.	unpack only one set of data:
get unpack_one.com S1A_SLC_TOPS_LA
7.	cd S1A_SLC_TOPS_LA
look at the files inside this folder: ls
README.txt	README_prep.txt	config.s1a.txt	raw		topo
In topo, there is a file dem.grd that covers the area of the SAR images, use grdinfo dem.topo to see its information.
In raw, there are two .SAFE directories and two .EOF files
The README_prep.txt tell you some pre information.
The README.txt file tells you how to run the program.
config.s1a.txt has all the custom processing parameters.

8.	Copy the commands in README.txt, but to keep the work background and print them in the log file

p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame.csh S1A_IW_SLC__1SSV_20150526T014935_20150526T015002_006086_007E23_679A.SAFE S1A_OPER_AUX_POEORB_OPOD_20150615T155109_V20150525T225944_20150527T005944.EOF S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20150607T014936_20150607T015003_006261_00832E_3626.SAFE S1A_OPER_AUX_POEORB_OPOD_20150627T155155_V20150606T225944_20150608T005944.EOF config.s1a.txt vv 1 >& log&

9.	Wait for the results: it can be like one hour. To display the processor activity:
top -o cpu
The results are in the merge directory, *.kml or *.png


An actual process:
1.	Download data and put the .SAFE and .EOF files in the raw directory (read David’s crash note).
2.	To make .grd file, use make_dem.csh

e.g.
make_dem.csh 77.5 86 -71.2 -68.4 3
and the we just need the file dem.grd, so delete all others.

To desample the dem.grd file:
grdsample dem.grd -I0.001/0.0005 -Gtem.grd

To merge two .grd files into one:
gmt grdblend dem1.grd dem3.grd -Gdem_all.grd -V -R73.9/81.8/-70.3/-67.5 -I0.001/0.0005




Data downloading:
https://vertex.daac.asf.alaska.edu/#
get the csv file, find the link to .zip file
wgetasf *.zip



Process data:
p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame.csh ref.SAFE ref.EOF rep.SAFE rep.EOF config.s1a.txt vv 1

here vv means vertical polarization. We use hh for ice caps.
To see different options, use p2p_S1_TOPS_Frame.csh

1 means run in multiple cores.

After getting the results, under directory F1/raw, there are two PRM files, use:
SAT_baseline *.PRM
To see the orbit information.


To kill a process:
ps -ax | grep gmt(or any key words)
kill axis(the axis displayed last step)

to unwrap phases, to go the merge directory
snaphu.csh .1 0 xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax
(see phase_filt.grd for the area that you are interested in)



to change the unwrapped interferogram from radar coordinate to geographic coordinate:
proj_ra2ll.csh trans.dat unwrap.grd unwrap_ll.grd

to project the unwrapped results in Google Earth:
  grep wave *PRM   % to see the wavelength (in meter)
  gmt grdmath unwrap_ll.grd 2 PI MUL DIV -27.7329 MUL = los_ll.grd
  gmt grdinfo los_ll.grd 
  gmt makecpt -Cpolar -T-200/200/10 -Z -D > los.cptg
  grd2kml.csh los_ll los.cpt 
  open los_ll.kml

Make contours in .kml:
gmt grdcontour los_ll.grd  –C10 –Dmexico1516.txt
gmt gmt2kml  mexico20152016.txt -Fl -W1p,white@75 > contours20152016.kml
open contours20152016.kml

to compare InSAR LOS deformation time series with GPS time series:
get the position of the GPS station: longitude(degree)/latitude(degree)/height(m) then calculate the LOS direction (East North Up). The last three parameters in look.txt is the LOS direction (East North Up) vector.
go to the merge directory:
       echo " -99.068 19.432 2226.590" | SAT_look S1_20150212_122529_F1.PRM > look_MMX1.txt


to look at the value at a certain point (lon, lat):
echo "-98.979000 19.484000" | gmt grdtrack -Glos_ll.grd















another method to unwrap phase:
change a parameter in the config.s1a.txt file:
threshold_snaphu
0 means wrapping phases, to make a comprise between processing time and accuracy, we can choose 0.1 here.


To change the region to unwrap in radar coordinates, first open phasefilt.grd under the merge file and choose the location of xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax:
ncview phasefilt.grd
for the Amery ice shelf case, we use 0/36656/0/13057
Mexico City: 44000/66000/3400/9600

open the config.s1a.txt file and change the region_cut parameter to xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax





To transform radar coordinates to geography ones, use:
proj_ra2ll.csh


To use computers at David’s lab:
ssh geosat
cd /Volumes/geosat/

exit when finishing working



find the 8m dem files in geosat:

ssh geosat
cd /palsar/DEM/REMA_8m
then unzip the files:
tar -xvf *.tar.gz
I would be needing the *_DEM.gif


To display disk usage statistics:
du –sh


geocode.csh 





export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/GMTSAR/bin


after get the .grd file, resample it to make finer even fake resolution.
grdsample *.grd -I / -Gnew.grd

after trying the 25 km + case, the different wavenumber bands and use a grid size of about 7/5 minutes


to convert a .grd file to .kml (.png)
grd2kml.csh file *.cpt

Be careful that it basically works for a small region. To project a much larger region, for example the whole globe, we need to change
some parameters (-Jx, DPI).

We can also use grd2geotiff.csh. to creat a .tiff file (we need to change
some parameters -Jx, DPI). 

grd2geotiff.csh file *.cpt

Then use image2qtree to creat .kml from .tiff
/usr/local/StereoPipeline/bin/image2qtree -o new_directory *.tiff

then look at the .kml under new_directory







grd2geotiff.csh file *.cpt

Then use image2qtree to creat .kml from .tiff
/usr/local/StereoPipeline/bin/image2qtree -o new_directory *.tiff






nan_land.com # to make the land NAN and resample grd file.
grd2geotiff_yy.csh vari_sampled vari.cpt
/usr/local/StereoPipeline/bin/image2qtree -o vari_sampled_25_100 vari_sampled.tiff
